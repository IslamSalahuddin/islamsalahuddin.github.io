      <h2>Module Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "During this module, we will cover the concepts and principles of KRR. 
        We will review methods and frameworks as well as tools to enable you to engage with, experience and envision current as well as 
        future developments in the area KRR as sub-discipline of AI. You will not only be equipped with theoretical and practical skills, 
        but this module will also make you aware of the practical applications of KRR as a key part of AI solutions."

      <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is a field concerned with how information about the world can be formally structured 
        and logically manipulated. It explores methods for encoding facts, concepts, relationships, and rules in a way that allows for 
        systematic inference, decision-making, and problem-solving. KRR draws from disciplines like logic, linguistics, and philosophy to 
        build frameworks that support understanding, explanation, and prediction across diverse domains—from mathematics to ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In artificial intelligence, KRR serves as the backbone for systems that require symbolic understanding and logical reasoning. 
        It enables machines to represent complex knowledge—such as ontologies, causal relationships, and temporal events—and to 
        draw conclusions through deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning. This is especially vital in applications like expert systems, 
        semantic web technologies, and explainable AI, where transparency and interpretability are key. 
        Modern AI increasingly blends KRR with statistical learning, using hybrid models to combine the precision of logic with 
        the adaptability of data-driven approaches.
