    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "This unit focuses on the end-to-end development of knowledge-based systems using
        ontology. It discusses the approach to ontology development as well as the methodology. It also discusses the
        approaches to evaluation based on a case study."

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        In this final unit, we wrapped up the module with a series of readings on the development and evaluation of an
        ontology
        for guiding appropriate antibiotic prescriptions and ontology development strategies in industrial contexts, in
        addition to
        the final chapter of the text book <i>Handbook of Knowledge Representation</i> on Knowledge Engineering. I also
        did an
        additional reading for an <a
          href="https://metadataweekly.substack.com/p/ontologies-context-graphs-and-semantic">
          an insightful article</a> that I came across on the direction of ontologies, context graphs and semantic
        layers in 2026.
        These readings collectively served as a wrap up for my main two questions that kept my mind busy throughout the
        module:
        1) What is the relation between ontologies -knowledge representation in general- and relational databases?
        2) Where do ontologies and knowledge representation stand in the era of large language models (LLMs)?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the assignment of the week is to submit an individual reflection on the whole module, which I will post
        to the
        <a href="../krr.html">the main page of the module</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Readings Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The first paper by Bright et al. (2012) provided an example paper of how to present the development and
        evaluation of an ontology,
        which made me reflect on my module's final assignment that I submitted in <a href="krr-unit11.html">Unit 11</a>.
        Since this paper
        did not have the 1000-word limit constraint, it was possible to present the paper in an IMRD format, which
        served the purpose of paper
        well. Other than this, I especially liked the paper's emphasis on incorporating domain expert feedback and
        review in the development
        and evaluation of the ontology. Had I read this paper before the submission of my <a
          href="../../../projects/library-ontology.html">final assignment</a>
        , I would have stated the absence of domain expert feedback as a limitation of my work. I also liked that the
        paper presented the
        the alerts generated by their ontology from a user perspective, showing that that the developed ontology's
        axioms are intact and
        serves the purpose of knowledge representation and reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second paper by Tarasov, Seigerroth and Sandkuhl (2019) focused on ontologies that bridge terminologies of
        business and IT
        (BITA), and how industrial contexts shape ontology development strategies for this purpose. The paper introduced
        a few development
        methodologies, like Ontology 101, Methontology, Extreme Design (XD) and hybrid approaches. It emphasised the
        discussion around
        the applicability of the conceptual models to problem solving systems and the ability to integrate or re-use
        existing ontologies,
        and build the new ones for further re-use by others. The paper provided several case studies, like OSTAG for
        software development,
        CLICK for research collaboration, SEMCO for automotive systems engineering and SEMA for semantic video object
        recognition.
        The paper made me think further about how an ontology can be developed in my own workplace and my team to bridge
        the gap
        between business and technical sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book chapter on Knowledge Engineering by Schreiber (2008) provided an insightful overview on Knowledge
        Engineering and where
        ontologies fit in it. Regarding ontologies, the chapter emphasised the importance of context, '“Context” is
        therefore an important notion when reusing an ontology. We cannot expect other people or programs to understand
        our conceptualization, if we do not explicate what the context of the ontology is.'
        It also summarised what I previously understood in the module that there are generally three types of
        ontologies: foundational, domain-specific and
        task-specific. That chapter added that although foundational ontologies are the ones that are closest to the
        philosophical notion of ontology, and are recieving
        a lot of attention, according to the author, most of ontologies are domain specific.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chapter also introduced me to the concepts of ontology engineering as a discipline, and the ontological
        commitments
        as an act that ontology engineers make, even if they are not aware of it. I may describe this act as how strict
        an ontology claims
        to represent reality, and which reality it claims to represent. Ontologies can have too many axioms that do not
        serve its purpose,
        and therefore is said to be 'over-committed'. Ontology commitments can also be biased, as in asserting that each
        user must
        have a first name and a last name, for example, which reflects a Western cultural bias. This last bit on
        ontological biases
        made me think about all the systems that we use every day, and how often we feel some discrepancies between them
        and the reality
        of the culture that it claims to be part of and represent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the chapter very concisely answered my first main lingering question on the relationship between
        ontologies and relational databases.
        In one paragraph, the author said, 'The difference between ontologies and data models does not lie in the
        language being used: you can define an ontology in a basic ER language (although you will be hampered in what
        you can say); similarly, you can write a data model with OWL. Writing
        something in OWL does not make it an ontology! The key difference is not the language the intended use. A data
        model is a model of the information in some restricted
        well-delimited application domain, whereas an ontology is intended to provide a set
        of shared concepts for multiple users and applications. To put it simply: data models
        live in a relatively small closed world; ontologies are meant for an open, distributed
        world (hence their importance for the Web).'
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you, Schreiber, the author of the chapter, for the answer!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the additional article that I read and that I want to highlight, by Talisman (2026) provided a
        connection between semantic
        layers, ontologies and context graphs, in the new context of AI agents and assistants, and a bit of historical
        contexts of how semantic layers have been used to solve the
        problem of discrepancy in metric calculation across databases in the domain of business intelligence, a problem
        that I can relate to.
        It further argues that, with the advent of AI, semantic layers are no longer enough, and ontologies are needed
        as they formally represent
        knowledge with its underlying concepts, relationships and constraints, and emphasise meaning, which enable
        reasoning and inference.
        It also provides a comparison between semantic layers, ontologies and context graphs that can be summarised as
        follows:
