      <h1>Machine Learning - Unit 6: Clustering with Python</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Last week we learned about clustering. This week, we will apply clustering (K-means only) on real life data using the Python libraries in scikit-learn.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>This week focused more on the hands-on implementation of K-Means Clustering in Python's Sickit-Learn, mainly through the unit's seminar. We were also encouraged to view Sickit-Learn's documentation on K-Means Clustering.</p>
        <p>Since I had previous experience with clustering, this unit as well was easy to go with. To practice the implementation of clustering, I had already implemented a project of clustering on asian religious texts <a href="https://github.com/IslamSalahuddin/asian_religious_texts_clustering">that can be viewed here. </a> The project uses three different clustering approaches, K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Hierarchical Clustering. I evaluated the three approaches and picked the Hierarchical Clustering as the most suitable approach for the task.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, this week also included the deadline for submitting the team project, so we had to finalise the report and submit, which we did successfully. The code base and documentation <a href="https://github.com/kyratzakos/UoEO-Machine-Learning-Module">can be viewied here </a>on a GitHub repository that was prepared by one of the team colleagues.</a></p>
