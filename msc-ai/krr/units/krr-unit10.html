      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "This unit focuses on the architecture of a knowledge-based system and how the
        various concepts discussed so far fits within.
        It also introduces further concepts to build on the knowledge of reasoning in knowledge-based systems."

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This unit was the first after the return from the winter break. I had only to do a quick reading for a paper on
        modeling a description logic vocabulary for cancer research
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046404000917">(Hartel et al., 2005)</a>, a quick
        formative activity building on Protégé pizza tutorial, and
        to provide peer responses for the collaborative discussion on ontology languages started in <a
          href="krr-unit9.html">the previous unit.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Reading Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Modeling a Description Logic Vocabulary for Cancer Research by <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046404000917">(Hartel et al., 2005)</a>
        offers a detailed explanation of how the National Cancer Institute developed a large description logic
        vocabulary to support cancer research. It presents the NCI Thesaurus as both
        a practical resource and a methodological example, showing how Ontylog’s features such as kinds, roles, and
        defined concepts enable precise modeling of diseases, anatomy,
        drugs, genes, and molecular abnormalities. The authors also describe how the vocabulary was converted into OWL
        Lite to improve interoperability, outlining the mapping choices
        and the limitations encountered during this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the technical modeling, the paper offers a structured approach for collaborating with domain
        experts who may not think in formal logic. It introduces tools such
        as use cases, pseudo T Box models, hierarchy reviews, and wireframe diagrams to help experts understand and
        refine the ontology. The authors highlight lessons about designing
        intuitive kinds, grounding modeling decisions in real user needs, and focusing on meaningful semantic
        relationships rather than the number of concepts.
        Through these contributions, the paper provides both a blueprint for building large biomedical ontologies and
        practical guidance for maintaining them in real research
        environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are a few quotes from the paper that I found insightful on ontology development in general:
      <ul>
        <li>As relations between concepts, roles are what drive the building of an ontology in determining the structure
          of the graph. A concept is modeled in the semantics of Ontylog as a set of things. It is the roles as
          relations between these sets of things that determine how the subsumption graph is created.</li>
        <li>However given the costs of ontology development one cannot go on doing that very long. Since no ontology is
          ever complete, a yardstick is needed to help decide where in the namespace to create fine granularity concept
          hierarchies and richly detailed inter-concept semantics on expressed user needs.</li>
        <li>[D]evelopers of applications that utilize ontologies should be encouraged to develop suites of regression
          tests to validate specific data that their applications utilize.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Artefacts</h2>
      <h3>Collaborative Discussion</h3>
      <h4>Peer Response 1</h4>
      <p>The first peer that I responded to argued that effective knowledge representation on the Web requires ontology
        languages with clear,
        formal semantics that both humans and software agents can interpret reliably. While RDF provides a basic
        structural foundation, it lacks the expressive power
        needed for reasoning, and alternatives such as OWL‑Lite and KIF are limited either by reduced expressiveness or
        poor scalability.
        In contrast, OWL 2 offers a strong balance of formal rigour, modelling capability, and compatibility with web
        standards, enabling automated reasoning and semantic
        interoperability across diverse data sources. Ongoing improvements in OWL 2 tooling further strengthen its
        suitability, leading to the conclusion that it best meets
        the criteria for representing shared conceptual knowledge on the World Wide Web.</p>
      <h5>My Response</h5>
      <p>Thank you for your comprehensive analysis of OWL2's suitability for expressing ontologies on the WWW. I
        strongly agree with your conclusion that OWL2 represents the optimal choice among the traditional ontology
        languages presented, particularly given its formal semantics, standardisation, and reasoning capabilities. Your
        point about RDF's limited expressiveness and OWL-Lite's intentional restrictions effectively demonstrates why
        OWL2 strikes the necessary balance between computational tractability and semantic richness (Ranatunga et al.,
        2025).</p>

      <p>However, I would like to extend the discussion beyond the four languages specified in the original question to
        consider contemporary developments in the agentic AI landscape. While OWL2 provides essential logical reasoning
        capabilities (what Magana and Monti (2025) describe as a "symbolic anchor" to mitigate LLM hallucinations) I
        argue that JSON-LD deserves equal consideration as a complementary ontology representation format for modern
        web-based agents.</p>

      <p>Recent agent communication protocols, including Agent Network Protocol (ANP) and Agent to Agent (A2A), have
        standardised on JSON-LD for representing agent capabilities and identities through Agent Cards (Agent Network
        Protocol, 2024; Kakde et al., 2025). This adoption reflects JSON-LD's unique position as semantic "glue" that
        combines RDF's graph-based rigour with JSON's developer accessibility, enabling agent discovery and
        interoperability at web scale.</p>

      <p>Your observation about OWL2's ongoing evolution through enhanced reasoning frameworks (Bilenchi, 2025) aligns
        with broader trends toward neuro-symbolic architectures, where formal ontologies constrain probabilistic AI
        systems. In this emerging paradigm, OWL2 and JSON-LD serve complementary roles: OWL2 provides logical guardrails
        and reasoning, while JSON-LD enables practical agent communication and discovery on the open internet.</p>

      <br>

      <h4>Peer Response 2</h4>
      <p>The second peer I responded to argued that while RDF lacks the semantic precision needed for reliable reasoning
        and OWL 2 can be overly complex and computationally demanding, OWL Lite offers a practical middle ground for
        web‑based software agents. It provides enough structure to support shared conceptual understanding while
        remaining lightweight, efficient, and easier to implement in distributed environments. By balancing essential
        ontology features with manageable complexity, OWL Lite is presented as the most suitable choice for scalable
        applications that depend on formal, consistent, and interoperable knowledge representation on the World Wide
        Web.</p>
      <h5>My Response</h5>
      <p>Thank you for presenting a well-reasoned argument for OWL Lite based on computational efficiency and practical
        scalability. Your emphasis on balancing expressiveness with implementability raises an important consideration
        for web-based agent systems, particularly where resource constraints exist. I appreciate your point that OWL2's
        advanced constructs may introduce unnecessary complexity in certain applications (W3C, 2012).</p>

      <p>However, I would respectfully challenge the premise that OWL Lite remains the optimal choice in the
        contemporary landscape of agentic AI. While OWL Lite's simplicity offered advantages historically, the language
        has been effectively deprecated since OWL 2's release, with W3C recommending migration to OWL 2 profiles (EL,
        QL, or RL) that provide equivalent or superior computational tractability while offering greater standardisation
        and tool support (Grau et al., 2008).</p>

      <p>More fundamentally, the emergence of large language models and neuro-symbolic architectures has shifted the
        computational bottleneck away from ontological reasoning complexity. Modern agents require formal ontologies not
        primarily for their own reasoning efficiency, but as "symbolic anchors" to constrain probabilistic AI systems
        and prevent hallucinations (Magana and Monti, 2025). In this context, OWL2's richer expressiveness becomes
        essential rather than burdensome, as it provides the logical guardrails necessary to ensure deterministic
        performance and traceability in LLM-driven applications.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, contemporary agent communication protocols have adopted JSON-LD rather than traditional OWL
        variants for practical interoperability. Agent Network Protocol, Agent to Agent, and Agent Communications
        Protocol all standardise on JSON-LD for Agent Cards, which enable agent discovery and collaboration through
        Decentralised Identifiers (Agent Network Protocol, 2024; Kakde et al., 2025). This suggests that practical
        scalability in modern multi-agent systems derives from lightweight semantic formats combined with formal OWL2
        reasoning where needed, rather than from restricting ontological expressiveness.</p>
