      <h2>Module Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "During this module, we will cover the concepts and principles of KRR.
        We will review methods and frameworks as well as tools to enable you to engage with, experience and envision
        current as well as
        future developments in the area KRR as sub-discipline of AI. You will not only be equipped with theoretical and
        practical skills,
        but this module will also make you aware of the practical applications of KRR as a key part of AI solutions."

      <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is a field concerned with how information about the world can be
        formally structured
        and logically manipulated. It explores methods for encoding facts, concepts, relationships, and rules in a way
        that allows for
        systematic inference, decision-making, and problem-solving. KRR draws from disciplines like logic, linguistics,
        and philosophy to
        build frameworks that support understanding, explanation, and prediction across diverse domains, from
        mathematics
        to ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In artificial intelligence, KRR serves as the backbone for systems that require symbolic understanding and
        logical reasoning.
        It enables machines to represent complex knowledge, such as ontologies, causal relationships, and temporal
        events, and to
        draw conclusions through deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning. This is especially vital in applications
        like expert systems,
        semantic web technologies, and explainable AI, where transparency and interpretability are key.
        Modern AI increasingly blends KRR with statistical learning, using hybrid models to combine the precision of
        logic with
        the adaptability of data-driven approaches.

      <h2>My End-of-Module Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Before the module</h3>

      <p>The Knowledge Reasoning and Representation (KRR) module was the one that I was most anticipating at the
        beginning of my master's programme. Among the other modules, this was the one that I clearly knew nothing about,
        so it got me curious. Furthermore, with a simple online search back then, I understood that KRR is a
        multidisciplinary domain that draws from philosophy and logic, and incorporates ideas from psychology to extend
        theories of how the human mind gains knowledge to machines (Schank and Abelson, 1977). So, driven by my
        curiosity and tendency for the fusion of domains, I was looking to get 12 weeks of mind-opening knowledge that
        connects my different interests and shows me things about artificial intelligence that I did not even know
        existed.</p>

      <p>Part of these expectations was not met and another part was satisfied. For the part that was not, I did not
        find much multidisciplinary nature to all the discussions, readings, seminars and lecturecasts, nor even in my
        additional resources that I went through over the three months of study. Beyond only brief contexts relating
        parts of the domain to philosophy and logic, I did not come across anything that links the domain to the
        psychology of human learning, nor anything that connects other humanities fields to the technical arena.
        However, everything in the module was new to me. Before, I knew nothing about things like logic formalisation
        techniques, ontologies, knowledge engineering, knowledge management and others.</p>

      <h3>During the module</h3>

      <p>Over the course of the module, week after week, I was being introduced to new concepts, subjects and practices,
        and it was upon me to further grasp them and understand where they fit in my own existing 'knowledge model';
        what all of this has to do with my work in business intelligence, my interests in data science, machine
        learning, deep learning and – of course – what it has to do with artificial intelligence (AI). The sequential
        novelty of topics that I was being introduced to kept delaying the formulation of such holistic understanding
        until the end. From the aspirations of the semantic web, and how it can be formulated through semantic layers,
        to Resource Description Framework (RDF), ontologies and their various languages, like Web Ontology Language
        (OWL), all the way through logic, propositional logic (PL), first-order logic (FOL), logic programming and
        Protégé software, the open-source ontology editor.</p>

      <p>My consistent feeling throughout the module was that I was not getting to a level of understanding that was
        satisfactory to me in any of these topics, so I tried, as much as I could, to look for additional resources,
        some of which I documented in my weekly reflections. What was more concerning for me was to connect all that I
        was learning with my work domain, which is business intelligence. Connecting between what I was learning and my
        work was a pursuit that was formulated through two main questions that I developed throughout the module and
        kept lingering on my mind till the very last week. The two questions are:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>How do ontologies – and knowledge representation in general – relate to relational and non-relational
          databases and data models?</li>
        <li>Do ontologies – and knowledge representation in general – still have a place in the age of large language
          models (LLMs) and AI agents?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The trace for my first question can be seen starting from my reflection on Unit 3 (mainly covering FOL). The
        second can be seen starting from Unit 9 when I had to start a discussion post answering the prompting question,
        "Which language do you believe is the most useful to express ontologies that can be utilised by software agents
        on the WWW: KIF, OWL2, RDF or OWL-lite?" The second one was more alarming for me as I was afraid that I was
        spending three months of my life studying something that had gone outdated, which, to my relief, I later
        discovered was not the case. I was able to reach answers for my two questions at the very end of the module.</p>

      <p>For my first question, the answer that I reached is concisely summarised in one paragraph from the closing
        chapter, by Schreiber (2008) of the module's textbook Handbook of Knowledge Representation, which was on the
        reading list for Unit 12, stating that a data model assumes a closed world among entities, while ontologies
        intend to lay the foundation for shared understanding of concepts, their relations and axioms among various
        human beings and systems (Schreiber, 2008). As such, a data model can be further proliferated as an ontology if
        needed.</p>

      <p>Linking to my second question, I came across an article, also in the very last week, that extrapolates on the
        state of semantic layers, ontologies and knowledge graphs in 2026 in the context of LLMs and AI agents. In
        addition to providing a historical overview that I needed on how semantic layers helped to unify the definition
        of measures in the domain of business intelligence, it also argued for the importance of ontologies to serve as
        a rigorous reality guardrail for LLMs and AI agents (Talisman, 2026). The last argument was a perspective that I
        had also learned when I did my research for my initial post for the collaborative discussion of Unit 9, in which
        I read, and therefore argued, that OWL2 and JSON-LD will be needed to maintain useful LLMs and AI agents (Magana
        and Monti, 2025).</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>The module did not meet all my expectations, and I am still struggling to connect all that I learned over the
        three months with my work. However, my effort of establishing such a connection, along with the required
        readings and additional resources, helped me formulate two questions, which I now find an extent of satisfaction
        that I was able to reach answers for. I know that I am not ready yet to introduce ontologies to my workplace,
        but I believe KRR is a domain that now exists in my mind, and that I now follow its related discussions, and
        will be thinking about moving forward, looking for an opportunity to make use of what I learned about it to
        solve real-world problems and live questions that I face, especially around the consistently challenging task of
        constructing shared realities among groups, whether work teams, developers and users, or people belonging to
        various cultural references.</p>
