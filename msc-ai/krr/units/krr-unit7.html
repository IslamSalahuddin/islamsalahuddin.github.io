      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "This unit focuses on one of the steps in developing accurate and efficient
        knowledge-based systems.
        It covers concepts and principles of knowledge acquisition, and approaches, to knowledge acquisition and
        formalism."

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This unit is composed of a lecturecast, a set of readings, and an assignment submission. The lecturecast and the
        readings overall introduced the topics
        of knowledge management and its relation to ontology, in light of formalism. This context extended my view for
        ontology, especially within business contexts
        to understand that an ontology is a way of formalism or knowledge representation, and might need to be preceded
        by knowledge acquisition through the means
        of information gathering, like interviews, observations, questionnaires, and document analysis.

      <p>
        The most notable reading for me wat the paper <a
          href="https://files.core.ac.uk/download/297021824.pdf">Knowledge elicitation techniques in a
          knowledge management context</a> by Gavrilova and Andreeva (2012), especially for introducing me to an even
        new domain, which is knowledge engineering (KE), and
        bridging between it and knowledge management (KM). According to the paper, KM focuses on how organisations
        capture, share and use knowledge for competitive
        advantage, while KE focuses on how to to develop technical methods and systems to represent, formalise and apply
        knowledge. The two domains are connected,
        but seemingly there is a gap between the two, at least on an academic level. For example, according to the
        paper, KM often assumes proactive employees, while
        KE recognises the need for structured elicitation methods. Also, KE introduces the role of the analyst in
        knowledge elicitation while the role did was overlooked
        by KM literature.

        As for the assignment, it was mainly about writing a 1500-word review article on the paper <a
          href="https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uniessexlib.idm.oclc.org/document/7100347">
          Ontology development for agriculture domain</a>, analysing the authors' methodology for ontology development,
        identifying key application areas of
        similar ontologies, and suggest how their approach can be adopted in our domains. Personally, I didn't see the
        paper a very good choice, as it was not well-structured
        nor written, and the suggested ontology was not even complete. However, it gave me an opportunity to read and
        write on the relation between ontology and
        business intelligence, which is my domain, as I am still trying to figure out how ontology relates to my work,
        and how it relates specially to the
        practice of data modelling, and maybe data visualisation as well.
