      <h1>Machine Learning - Unit 12: Industry 4.0 and Machine Learning</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The so-called “smartisation” of industries, often referred to as Industry 4.0, represents a paradigm shift driven by artificial 
          intelligence, automation, and machine learning. With the rapid advancement of AI and ML, we are moving towards a world where 
          self-learning systems, efficient AI architectures, and edge computing are becoming the backbone of modern technological ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machine learning is evolving beyond traditional supervised learning, with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) unlocking AI’s ability to 
          learn from unlabelled data, Edge AI enabling real-time decision-making on low-power devices, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) 
          automating deep learning model design. These future trends are shaping the next era of AI-powered solutions across healthcare, 
          finance, autonomous systems, and smart cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, we will explore these cutting-edge trends in machine learning and their impact on Industry 4.0 applications.

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Again, this unit was out of narrative and did not make sense to me, as it reverted back once more to Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, covered by two more reading
          pieces, in addition to other unrelated reading pieces covering deepfakes and GANs.  
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as this is the final unit of the module, it was time to submit the e-Portfolio. So, I spent time finalising these pages to get them ready for submission.

      <h2>Artefacts</h2>
        <p>
          No artefacts were required for this unit.
