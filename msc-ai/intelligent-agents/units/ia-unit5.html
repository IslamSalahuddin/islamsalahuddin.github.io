      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As per the course website, "This week’s lecturecast focuses on the way in which agents communicate with each
        other. The lecturecast also looks at the theory of language with Speech Acts and then provides an example of an
        agent communication language (KQML). Finally, an introduction to ontologies and the way they can be used in
        agent communications will be discussed."

      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This week was an interesting one. It focused on communication between agents, but to do so it started from the
        philosophy of language between humans, which was interesting and satisfying for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lecturecast of the unit gave an overview for both topics, introducing Speech Acts that was pioneered by J.
        L. Austin and John R. Searle, and is a theory that is generally concerned with how utterance of words initiates
        actions in a social context, rather than being mere expression of a proposition. The lecturecast then proceeded
        to introduce Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), espcially Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML)
        and its Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) that can be used to express ontologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The readings then covered the same area with two reading items. The first was the introduction and Chapter 1
        from <i>Speech Acts</i> book by Searle (1969). The second was the paper <i>Negotiating over Ontological
          Correspondences
          with Asymmetric and Incomplete Knowledge</i> by Payne and Tamma (2014).
      </p>
      <h3>Readings Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        It was interesting for me to read about philosophy of language through <i>Speech Acts</i>, from which I learned
        about locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts. Below are some of the quotes that I liked from the
        introduction and the first chapter:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "I take it to be an analytic truth about language that whatever can be meant can be said. A given language may
          not have a syntax or a vocabulary rich enough for me to say what I mean in thatlanguage but there are no
          barriers in principle to supplementing the impoverished language or saying what I mean in a richer one."
        </li>
        <li>
          "The hypothesis then of this work is that speaking a language is engaging in a rule-governed form of behavior.
          To put it more briskly, talking is performing acts according to rules."
        </li>
        <li>
          "[S]ome philosophers ask, 'How can making a promise create an obligation?' A similar question would be, 'How
          can scoring a touchdown create six points ? ' As they stand both questions can only be answered by citing a
          rule of the form, ' X counts as Y', which is, of course, not to say that the questions cannot be rephrased to
          ask important questions about the institution of promising—or for that matter, football."
        </li>
        <li>
          "Sometimes in order to explain adequately a piece of human behavior we have to suppose that it was done in
          accordance with a rule, even though the agent himself may not be able to state the rule and may not even be
          conscious of the fact that he is acting in accordance with the rule."
        </li>
        <li>
          "In an article entitled Meaning^ Grice gives the following analysis of the notion of "non-natural meaning". To
          say that a speaker S meant something by X is to say that S intended the utterance of X to produce some effect
          in a hearer H by means of the recognition of this intention."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the second reading on <i>Negotiating over Ontological Correspondences with Asymmetric and Incomplete
          Knowledge</i>, the paper aimed to introduce the concept of <i>Correspondence Inclusion Dialogue (CID)</i>, a
        protocol of multi-agent communication, by which agents negotiate by exchancing beliefs of the utilities for each
        correspondence. Published in 2014, the paper introduced CID protocol to solve the gap of having prior research
        concerened with asymmetric-knowledge agents communication focusing on two approaches. The first was that agents
        exchange messages of conceptual definitions so that each agent would mutate their ontologies for alignment, and
        the second was to focus on argumentation techniques on the type of correspondence to discover mutully acceptable
        alignments. Both approaches rely on having the onotologies of the agent parties being fully shared. Instead, the
        CID that was proposed by this paper is built on:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          "Each agent is aware of a set of correspondences, each with an associated degree of belief."
        </li>
        <li>
          "There should be no ambiguity with respect to either the source entities in the resulting alignment, or the
          target entities."
        </li>
        <li>
          "If alternative choices of correspondences exist, the selection is based on the combined, or joint degree of
          belief of both agents."
        </li>
        <li>
          "No correspondences should be selected where their joint degree of belief is less than some defined
          admissibility threshold."
        </li>
        <li>
          "The alignment should be generated by disclosing as few beliefs as possible."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The paper then proceeds to give an example implemetation between two agents, named Alice and Bob, with
        illustrative tables and figures for the correspondences and negotionation sequence and associated degrees of
        belief and how they map between ontological entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reading the paper, I had two main concerns. One being that I obviously do not know how I can practically
        implement this. The second was that I had concern that the paper is from 2014, and I kept thinking how it
        relates to the present, and where CID falls among the recent agent communication protocols. I recently learnt
        about the Agent 2 Agent (A2A) communication protocol, and at the time of writing this page, I have a challenge
        at work to develop an LLM-based agent using A2A protocol, so I am highly focused on my need to learn more about
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To tackle the second concern at least, I did a quick research from which I learnt that CID and A2A are from very
        different eras, assumptions and technical motivations, and the relationship can be understood as conceptual
        lineage. While CID is an early, formal and logic-based negotiation protocol that was designed for symbolic
        agents to exchange beliefes about ontology correspondences, A2A is by contrast a modern, LLM-driven
        communication paradigm, in which agents coordinae using natural language, implicit reasoning, and learned
        representations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then started thinking that maybe logic-based protocols, like CID can be integrated with A2A to provide a
        semantic layer to agent communications, constructing a guardrail for multi-agent syestems, and idea that I had
        from the previous <a href="../../krr/krr.html">Knowledge Representation and Reasoning module</a>, and that I
        have pointed to in one of my peer responses on the first collaborative discussion during <a
          href="ia-unit2.html">Unit 2</a>. I looked up any research on possible integration between CID and A2A, and
        found none that is specifically on the topic. However, I found an interesting paper on the use of logic
        formalisation on top of a multi-agent system (MAS) built for cross-domain art translation (Matanski <i>et
          al.</i>, 2025), which was also interesting for given it tackles the use for intelligent agents in the artistic
        practices, a domain which I intend to pursue after my master's degree. To sum up, I'm still not sure whether the
        lack of reasearch on possible integration between CID and A2A is a reasearch gap or a question that has become
        simply outdated, but that in itself is a question to be further explored.

      <h2>Artefacts</h2>
      <h3>Collaborative Discussion 2</h3>
      <p>
        This week also included the start of the second collaborative discussion. The prompt was to answer the question,
        'What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of the use of agent communication languages such as KQML?
        How do they compare with method invocation in Python or Java?' Below I share my initial post.
      </p>
      <h4>Initial Post</h4>
      <p>
        Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), like KQML, are designed for heterogenous, autonomous, knowledge-based
        agents in distributed environments that do not assume shared code structure or known interfaces, while method
        invocation in Python or Java requires shared code structures and known interfaces (Mayfield, Labrou and Finin,
        2005).
      </p>
      <p>
        The contrast can be drawn parallel to an analogy of making request within the same organisation, where the
        sender of the request knows exactly who should perform the request, pulling which strings in the organisation's
        operation workflow, as opposed to sending a request to another independent organisation, informing it of the
        intent and the goal, and leaving the way of execution to be evaluated by that independent organisation according
        to its own operations and rules. The first represents how method invocation works, while the latter represents
        how ACLs and KQML work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, KQML is a communication protocol that is based on agent intent, rather than being a direct procedural
        execution method. This allows multi-agent systems (MAS) that are built on KQML to be autonomous and
        interoperable in distributed environments (Mayfield, Labrou and Finin, 2005), allowing for flexibility in
        coordination rooted on their dependency on semantics rather than sticking to strict syntax, and counting for
        heterogeneity of agents' code bases (Finin et al., 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, ACLs, being based on the theory of Speech Acts, with their full promised full flexibility remains
        tricky to achieve. The first reason - and disadvantage - is that they require a symmetric, shared ontology
        between agents for the communication to be effective and correct. Without such shared ontology, communication
        may yield incorrect agent interpretations for performatives (like implement, tell, achieve... etc.). There is an
        accumulative body of research that aimed to deal with asymmetric agents that do not have a shared ontology, but
        the implementations of these approaches add to the technical burden of engineering fully communicable agents in
        ACLs (Finin et al., 1994). There is also an initial technical burden in formalising the logic of the
        communication and all of their ontological references in a way that guarantees consistent interpretation across
        implementations (Mayfield, Labrou and Finin, 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum up, ACLs and KQML were a step in the right direction of establishing a way for communication among
        heterogenous agents, but they had their challenges that mainly stem from their dependency on logic
        formalisation. I believe that those shortcomings were dealt with - or rather skipped - by the recent agent
        communication protocols that are dependent on natural language models, rather than logic formalisation, like
        Agent 2 Agent (A2A) protocol (Agent Network Protocol (ANP), 2024), about which I look forward to learning more
        in the near future.
